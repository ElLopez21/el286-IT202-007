    2. **Important**: The function that drives one of the challenges is `updateCurrentPage(str)` which takes 1 parameter, a string of the word to display as the current page. This function is not included in the code of the page, along with a few other things, are linked via an external js file. Make sure you do not delete this line.  
5. Create a branch called M3-Challenge-HW if you haven't yet
6. Add this template to that branch (git add/git commit)
7. Make a pull request for this branch once you push it
8. You may manually deploy the HW branch to dev to get the evidence for the below prompts
9. Create a new file **m3_submission.md** file in the hw branch and fill it with the output generated from this page (be careful not to paste more than once)
10. Add, commit, and push the submission file
11. Close the pull request by merging it to dev (double-check all looks good on dev)
12. Manually create a new pull request from dev to prod (i.e., base: prod <- compare: dev)
13. Complete the merge to deploy to production
14. Submit the direct link of the m3_submission.md from the prod branch to Canvas for this submission

<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> Briefly explain how you made the navigation horizontal</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>Since the li in the navigation (nav li) is basically a block element,<br>I set the display to being inline which means it won&#39;t start from<br>a new line.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 2: </em> Briefly explain how you remove the navigation list item markers</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>When I set the navigation to horizontal, it basically removed the the item<br>markers automatically, however, I simply used &quot;list-style: none&quot; just in case.&nbsp;<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 3: </em> Briefly explain how you gave the navigation a background</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>Simply chose the nav tag as my selector and added a background color<br>to it which is a grey color.<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 4: </em> Briefly explain how you made the links (or their surrounding area) change color on mouseover/hover</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I went over the &quot;CSS Selector Reference&quot; and found &quot;a:hover&quot;. Whenever the move<br>hovers over the links it&#39;ll be selected. In this case, whenever it&#39;s hovered,<br>I made their surrounding area to be a reddish color using &quot;background-color&quot;.&nbsp;<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 5: </em> Briefly explain how you changed the challenge list bullet points to checkmarks (✓)</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I did a bit of digging and used the &quot;content&quot; property to make<br>the bullet points to checkmarks. The content property is used along with ::before,<br>which in this case it&#39;ll be before the list so, li::before.&nbsp;<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 6: </em> Briefly explain how you made the first character of the h1 tags and anchor tags uppercased</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>At first I had h1, a { text-transform: uppercase;}, but realized that it<br>uppercased all of the letters which is not part of the objective. Using<br>the text-transform, I used another value which is &quot;capitalize&quot; and it capitalizes the<br>first character of each word.<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 7: </em> Briefly explain/describe your custom styling of your choice</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I simply chose to style the h3 which displays &quot;Challenge&quot; and made it<br>to be a light purple color by selecting the h3 and using &quot;color&quot;<br>to change the color.&nbsp;<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 8: </em> Briefly explain how the styling for the challenge list doesn't impact the navigation list</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>The styling for the challenge list doesn&#39;t impact the navigation list due the<br>amount of specificity. For instance, making the bullet points to checkmarks by just<br>using li::before{content:&#39;✓&#39;;} will effect the navigation list by adding checkmarks to it. In<br>order for this to not impact the navigation, I specified a bit more<br>on the li and used h3~ul li::before{content:&#39;✓&#39;;}. It focuses from the h3 below.&nbsp;<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 9: </em> Briefly explain how you updated the content of the h1 tag with the link text</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I started off by declaring a variable that holds a DOM method &quot;getElementsByTagName&quot;<br>that finds the &quot;a&quot; element. Using that method will find all of the<br>&quot;a&quot; elements which targets that login, register, profile, and logout. Now, in order<br>to go through each in one of these links, I used a for<br>loop. Inside the for loop, I declared another variable in which it holds<br>the index value specific value of the &quot;links&quot; (login, register, profile, and logout).<br>I then attached an event listener that holds an event which is &quot;click&quot;,<br>and an anonymous function (function(event)). When the link is clicked, it gives out<br>a set of instructions, in this case the anonymous function is called. It<br>listens to the &quot;click&quot; event and once it&#39;s clicked, the h1 tag and<br>title tag should update its content.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Furthermore, I declared a variable that holds the<br>textContent of the specified index value and another variable that contains a DOM<br>method &quot;getElementsByTagName&quot; that finds the &quot;h1&quot; element. We only have one h1 so<br>it doesn&#39;t really matter in terms of using the specific method I used.<br>In my code have the variable declared as &quot;ele&quot; and it&#39;s then used<br>as ele.textContent = link; which updates the text content of the h1 to<br>the one of the links.&nbsp;</div><br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 10: </em> Briefly explain how you updated the content of the title tag with the link text</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>In order to target the title,&nbsp; I used the title property which is<br>document.title and set it equal to the variable &quot;link&quot; to which it contains<br>the textContent of the link.&nbsp;<br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> Comment briefly talking about what you learned and/or any difficulties you encountered and how you resolved them (or attempted to)</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>The main difficulties I&#39;ve encountered was to come about doing the the whole<br>process of changing the text content to another when the links were clicked.<br>I&#39;ve gone through so many documentation in order to grasp some understanding on<br>how to come about the problem. Some of them have similar ways of<br>approaching the problem in terms of using the event listener and how the<br>DOM is used. Thanks to the &quot;basic breakdown&quot;&nbsp; that professor Toegel put out<br>there. It really helped in layering out the code in order tackle the<br>problem and come with some solution. A lot of trial and error and<br>getting the comprehension of what each any part of the DOM is used.&nbsp;<br></p><br></td></tr>
